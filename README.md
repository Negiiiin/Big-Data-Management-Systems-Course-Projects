# Big-Data-Management-Systems-Course-Projects

This folder contains the four individual projects that I had in my big data management systems course of the data science specialization.

In this course I learned about NoSQL databases and had an assignment about MongoDB.

I also got familiar with Hadoop.

My last two assignments were about PySpark. In the first assignment I practiced implementing data queries using pyspark. In my second PySpark assinment I used ML algorithms to build models. One part of this assignment is about building a model that predicts diamond prices.

I used databricks to use pyspark. The link to my databricks notebooks are in the pdf files.

The assignments were on the topics of:
- MongoBD
- Hadoop
- PySpark
- Building ML Models Using PySpark
